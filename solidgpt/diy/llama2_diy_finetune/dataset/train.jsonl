This page allows users to send a new offer to a candidate by providing details such as the candidate's name, salary, and start date.\n\nThe file starts with the `id` key, which specifies the ID of the page as \"SendOffer\". The `type` key defines the type of page, in this case, it is a `PageHeaderMenu`, which indicates that the page will have a header menu.\n\nThe `properties` key contains the properties specific to the page. In this example, the `title` property is set to \"Send an Offer\", which will be displayed as the title of the page.\n\nThe `areas` key defines the different areas within the page layout. In this case, there is a single area named \"content\". The `justify` property is set to \"center\", which aligns the content in the center of the area.\n\nWithin the \"content\" area, there is a single block named \"content_card\". This block is of type `Card` and has a `maxWidth` style property set to 800, which limits the maximum width of the card.\n\nInside the \"content_card\" block, there is a block named \"content\" of type `Result`. This block displays a result message with a title, subtitle, and icon. The `title` property is set to \"Send a new offer to a candidate\" and the `subTitle` property is set to \"Provide details of a candidate to send an offer\". The `icon` property specifies the name and color of the icon to be displayed.\n\nThe \"content\" block also has an `areas` key, which defines additional areas within the block.

Here is a breakdown of its functionality based on the readme and annotations:\n\n- The YAML file represents a page with a header menu (PageHeaderMenu).\n- The \"onInit\" event is triggered when the page initializes and sets the initial state of the \"order_id\" parameter to null.\n- The page has a title property set to \"Some form\" and is centered using layout properties.\n- The content of the page is wrapped inside a Card component (Card).\n- Inside the Card component, there is a Title component (Title) with the content \"Entry Form\" displayed as a heading.\n- There is a MultipleSelector component (MultipleSelector) with options for selecting items. When an option is selected, the \"onChange\" event is triggered, and the selected item is updated in the state using the \"update_item\" SetState action.\n- There is a TextInput component (TextInput) for displaying the first selected item. It is initially disabled but can be updated based on the selected item in the MultipleSelector component.\n- There is an Html component (Html) for displaying an attachment input field. The attachment input field is of type \"file\" and has an associated label. When the component mounts, the \"onMount\" event is triggered and executes a JsAction called \"uploadFileAsync\" with the input_file as an argument.\n- There is a Button component (Button) with the title \"Submit\". When clicked, it triggers several actions, including validation, displaying a success message using the Message component, and resetting the form.\n- The commented-out lines represent additional actions that can be added, such as submitting the order and placing the order using Request actions.\n\nOverall, the YAML file represents a form page with various components and event handlers for capturing user input and performing actions based on that input.","completion":"id: new-order\ntype: PageHeaderMenu\n\nevents:\n  onInit:\n    - id: generate_id\n      type: SetState\n      params: \n        order_id: \n          _uuid: null\n\nproperties:\n  title: Some form\nlayout:\n  contentJustify: center\nblocks:\n\n  - id: content_card\n    type: Card\n    layout:\n      size: 800\n      contentGutter: 16\n    blocks:\n      - id: page_heading\n        type: Title\n        properties:\n          content: Entry Form\n          level: 3\n\n      \n      - id: item_select\n        type: MultipleSelector\n        properties:\n          placeholder: Select items\n          required: true\n          label:\n            title: \"Some Selection\"\n            inline: true\n            extraStyle:\n              font-style: bold\n          options:\n           - \"One\"\n           - \"Two\"\n           - \"Three\"\n           - \"Four\"\n        events:\n          onChange:\n            - id: update_item\n              type: SetState\n              params:\n                item:\n                  _state: item_select.0\n\n      - id: item\n        type: TextInput\n        layout:\n          span: 8\n        properties:\n          label:\n            title: First selected Item\n            inline: true\n          disabled: true\n\n      - id: file_attachment\n        type: Html\n        layout:\n          span: 12\n        properties:\n          title: Icon\n          html: <label for=\"input_file\">Attachment (optional):<\/label><input type=\"file\" id=\"input_file\" name=\"input_file\" accept=\"*\">\n          label:\n            span: 10\n            align: right\n        events:\n           onMount:\n             - id: upload_file\n               type: JsAction\n               params:\n                 name: uploadFileAsync\n                 args:\n                   - input_file\n\n      - id: submit_button\n        type: Button\n        layout:\n          push: 19\n        properties:\n          color: '#52c41a'\n          icon: SaveOutlined\n          title: Submit\n          size: large\n        events:\n          onClick:\n\n            - id: validate_order\n              type: Validate\n\n            #- id: submit_order\n            #  type: Request\n            #  params:\n            #    place_order\n\n            - id: notify_user\n              type: Message\n              params:\n                status: success\n                duration: 5\n                description: Submitted successfully\n\n            - id: reset_form\n              type: Reset\n\n"}
{"prompt":"The name of the Lowdefy YAML file is \"no_tickets.yaml\".\n\nBased on the README and the annotations in the YAML file, it appears that this YAML file defines a function that checks if there are no tickets in the case management app. The function uses logical operators to evaluate two conditions: whether the length of the tickets_list array is equal to 0 and whether the tickets are not currently loading.\n\nThe YAML file includes the following components:\n- _and: This is a logical operator that checks if both conditions are true.\n- _eq: This is a logical operator that checks if the two values are equal.\n- _array.length: This is a keyword that returns the length of an array.\n- _if_none: This is a keyword that returns a default value if the specified state is null or undefined.\n- _state: This is a keyword that refers to the state of the application. In this case, it refers to the tickets_list state.\n- _not: This is a logical operator that negates the result of the condition.\n- _ref: This keyword is used to reference other YAML files that define the conditions to be checked.\n\nThe function checks if both the length of the tickets_list array is equal to 0 (using the _array.length and _eq operators) and the tickets are not currently loading (using the tickets_loading.yaml reference).

The _and and _not operators are used to evaluate and negate the result, so if there are no tickets, the function returns true.\n\nOverall, this YAML file defines a function that checks if there are no tickets in the case management app. It returns true if there are no tickets and false if there are tickets or if the tickets are currently loading.","completion":"_and:\n  - _eq:\n      - _array.length:\n          _if_none:\n            - _state: tickets_list\n            - []\n      - 0\n  - _not:\n      _ref: pages\/tickets\/logic\/tickets_loading.yaml\n"}
{"prompt":"Based on the README and the annotation in the YAML file, the `_switch.yaml` file is a YAML configuration file that defines the `_switch` operator in Lowdefy.\n\nThe `_switch` operator is used to evaluate an array of conditions and return the `then` argument of the first item for which the `if` argument evaluates to `true`. If none of the conditions evaluate to `true`, the value of the `default` argument is returned.\n\nThe `_switch` operator takes the following arguments:\n\n- `branches`: An array of objects that represent the conditions and their corresponding values. Each object in the array has two properties:\n  - `if: boolean`: The boolean result of a test.\n  - `then: any`: The value to return if the test is `true`.\n- `default: any`: The value to return if none of the conditions evaluate to `true`.\n\nThe YAML file also provides an example of how to use the `_switch` operator. In the example, the `_switch` operator is used to return a value based on a series of conditions. Each condition is represented by an object in the `branches` array, with the `if` property representing the test and the `then` property representing the value to return if the test is `true`. If none of the conditions evaluate to `true`, the value of the `default` argument is returned.\n\nOverall, the `_switch.yaml` file defines the behavior and usage of the `_switch` operator in Lowdefy, allowing users to perform conditional evaluations and return values based on those evaluations.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/operators.yaml.njk\n  transformer: templates\/operatorsMethodTransformer.js\n  vars:\n    pageId: _switch\n    pageTitle: _switch\n    filePath: operators\/_switch.yaml\n    build: true\n    types: |\n      ```\n      (arguments: {branches: {if: boolean, then: any}[], default: any}): any\n      ```\n    description: |\n      The `_switch` operator evaluates an array of conditions and returns the `then` argument of the first item for which the `if` argument evaluates to `true`.

It also includes examples of how to configure the connection, specifying the required properties and using secrets to store sensitive information.\n\nIn addition to the connection configuration, the template also mentions two request types related to AWS S3: \"AwsS3PresignedGetObject\" and \"AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy\". It describes the properties of each request type, including options for getting a download link for an object and creating a policy for uploading a file to S3. Examples are provided for both request types, demonstrating how to configure and use them.\n\nThe template concludes with a guide on creating an S3 bucket, including steps to create an AWS account, create an S3 bucket, set CORS settings for the bucket, and create an IAM user with the necessary permissions. It provides JSON configurations for CORS and IAM policies and instructs users to set the access key ID and secret access key in the Lowdefy secrets store.\n\nOverall, this YAML file serves as a template for configuring the \"AWSS3\" connection and related requests in Lowdefy, allowing users to connect to an AWS S3 bucket, perform actions such as downloading and uploading files, and follow a guide for setting up the necessary AWS resources.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/general.yaml.njk\n  vars:\n    pageId: AWSS3\n    pageTitle: Amazon S3\n    section: Connections\n    filePath: connections\/AWSS3.yaml\n    content:\n      - id: markdown\n        type: MarkdownWithCode\n        properties:\n          content: |\n            AWS S3 is a file or data storage solution, provided by Amazon Web Services. S3 does not work like a traditional file system, data is stored as objects in a collection of objects called a bucket.\n            Objects can be read from S3 and stored in S3 using web requests. These objects can be public or private. You can read more [here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AmazonS3\/latest\/dev\/Welcome.html).\n\n            Lowdefy integrates with AWS S3 using presigned links. These are links that are authorized to give access to private objects, or that allow you to create new objects, and that expire after a certain amount of time. This allows you to upload or download directly from S3 from the browser.\n\n            A guide to creating and connecting to an S3 bucket is given at the bottom of this page.\n\n            ## Connections\n\n            Connection types:\n              - AwsS3Bucket\n\n            ### AwsS3Bucket\n\n            The `AwsS3Bucket` connection is used to connect to a AWS S3 bucket. AWS S3 is the file storage solution provided by Amazon Web services.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `accessKeyId: string`: __Required__ - AWS IAM access key id with s3 access.\n            - `secretAccessKey: string`: __Required__ - AWS IAM secret access key with s3 access.\n            - `region: string`: __Required__ - AWS region bucket is located in.\n            - `bucket: string`: __Required__ - S3 bucket name.\n            - `read: boolean`: Default: `true` - Allow reads from the bucket.\n            - `write: boolean`: Default: `false` - Allow writes to the bucket.\n\n            #### Examples\n\n            ###### Read and writes on a bucket:\n            ```yaml\n            connections:\n              - id: my_bucket\n                type: AwsS3Bucket\n                properties:\n                  accessKeyId:\n                    _secret: S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID\n                  secretAccessKey:\n                    _secret: S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n                  region: eu-west-1\n                  bucket: my-bucket-name\n                  write: true\n            ```\n            Environment variables:\n            ```\n            LOWDEFY_SECRET_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\n            LOWDEFY_SECRET_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = wJalrXUtnFEMI\/K7MDENG\/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\n            ```\n\n            ## Requests\n\n            Request types:\n              - AwsS3PresignedGetObject\n              - AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy\n\n            ### AwsS3PresignedGetObject\n\n            The `AwsS3PresignedGetObject` request is used to get a download link for an object in AWS S3. The link provided by this request can be opened using the `Link` action.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `versionId: string`: VersionId used to reference a specific version of the object.\n            - `expires: number`: Number of seconds for which the policy should be valid.\n            - `key: string`: __Required__ - Key (or filename) under which object will be stored. If another file is saved with the same key, that file will be overwritten, so a random string in this field is probably needed.\n            - `responseContentType: string`: Sets the Content-Type header of the response.\n            - `responseContentDisposition: string`: Sets the Content-Disposition header of the response.\n\n            #### Examples\n\n            ###### Download a pdf and open in a new tab:\n            ```yaml\n            requests:\n              - id: my_file_link\n                type: AwsS3PresignedGetObject\n                connectionId: my_bucket_connection\n                properties:\n                  key: pdf-filename-as4dacd.pdf\n                  responseContentType: application\/pdf\n\n                    ...\n                    blocks:\n                      - id: getFileButton\n                        type: Button\n                        events:\n                          onClick:\n                            - id: open_file\n                              type: Link\n                              params:\n                                url:\n                                  _request: my_file_link\n                                newTab: true\n            ```\n\n            ### AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy\n\n            The `AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy` request is used to create a policy that allows a file to be uploaded to AWS S3. This is used by a block like the `S3Uploadbutton` to upload a file.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `acl: enum`: Access control lists used to grant read and write access.\n              - private\n              - public-read\n              - public-read-write\n              - aws-exec-read\n              - authenticated-read\n              - bucket-owner-read\n              - bucket-owner-full-control\n            - `conditions: object[] | string[][]`: Conditions to be enforced on the request. An array of objects, or condition arrays. See [here](https:\/\/docs.aws.amazon.com\/AmazonS3\/latest\/API\/sigv4-HTTPPOSTConstructPolicy.html).\n            - `expires: number`: Number of seconds for which the policy should be valid.\n            - `key: string`: __Required__ - Key (or filename) under which object will be stored. If another file is saved with the same key, that file will be overwritten, so a random string in this field is probably needed.\n\n\n            #### Examples\n\n            ###### Upload a file with user filename and random id:\n            ```yaml\n            - id: my_post_policy\n              type: AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy\n              connectionId: my_bucket_connection\n              properties:\n                key:\n                  _nunjucks:\n                    template: uploads\/{{filename}}-{{uid}}\n                    on:\n                      filename:\n                        _args: filename\n                      uid:\n                        _args: filename\n            ```\n\n            ## Creating a bucket\n\n            ###### Step 1 - Create an AWS account\n\n            Go to the [AWS homepage](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/) and create an account if you don't already have one. you can find more information [here](https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/premiumsupport\/knowledge-center\/create-and-activate-aws-account\/).\n\n            ###### Step 2 - Create an S3 bucket\n\n            1. Once logged in, search for S3 in the search box.\n            2. Click 'Create Bucket'\n            3. Choose a name and AWS region for your bucket\n            4. Continue creating the bucket with any extra settings is needed.\n            5. Make sure the 'Block all public access' box is ticked if you don't want to allow public access.\n            6. Click 'Create Bucket'\n\n            ###### Step 3 - Set the CORS settings for your bucket\n\n            CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a security feature that is used to restrict web applications from accessing resources from different origins, or domain names. To allow your Lowdefy app to access the contents of the bucket, you need to add a CORS rule on the bucket that authorizes your app\n\n            1. Click on you bucket.\n            2. Click on the 'Permissions' tab.\n            3. Click on the 'CORS Configuration' tab.\n            4. Paste this configuration and save (Fill in your own Lowdefy domain name).\n\n            ```json\n            [\n                {\n                    \"AllowedHeaders\": [\n                        \"*\"\n                    ],\n                    \"AllowedMethods\": [\n                        \"GET\", \"PUT\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\", \"HEAD\"\n                    ],\n                    \"AllowedOrigins\": [\n                        \"https:\/\/YOUR_LOWDEFY_DOMAIN_HERE\"\n                    ],\n                    \"ExposeHeaders\": []\n                }\n            ]\n            ```\n\n            ###### Step 4 - Create an IAM user\n\n            IAM is the AWS identity and access management system. This can be used to give very granular access permissions. We will create a programmatic user that has the rights to read and write objects in the Bucket.\n\n            1. In the 'Services' dropdown in the header, search for 'IAM'.\n            2. Click on 'Users' in the menu on the left.\n            3. Click 'Add User'\n            4. Choose a descriptive name for the user.\n            5. Choose programmatic access and click next.\n            6. Choose 'Attach existing policies directly'.\n            7. Choose 'Create Policy'.\n            8. Choose the JSON tab and paste the following (Fill in your own bucket name):\n            ```JSON\n            {\n                \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n                \"Statement\": [\n                    {\n                        \"Sid\": \"ListObjectsInBucket\",\n                        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                        \"Action\": [\"s3:ListBucket\"],\n                        \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE\"]\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"Sid\": \"AllObjectActions\",\n                        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n                        \"Action\": \"s3:*Object\",\n                        \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME_HERE\/*\"]\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n            ```\n\n            9. Choose review policy and save.\n            10. In your previous tab, refresh and search for the policy you just created. Attach it to the user.\n            11. Click next, review and create the user.\n            12. Set the access key id and secret access key in your Lowdefy secrets store.\n"}

{"prompt":"The YAML file is named \"listagem1.yaml\" and it represents a screen template for a list view in a web application using the Lowdefy framework.\n\nThe YAML file includes components such as a text input field for adding items to the list, a button for adding items, a list component for displaying the items, and an icon component for removing items.\n\nThe components are organized in a hierarchical structure using blocks, where each block represents a specific component or group of components. The layout properties define the positioning and styling of the components on the screen.\n\nThe event handlers define the actions to be performed when buttons are clicked. For example, when the \"Adicionar\" (Add) button is clicked, a new item is added to the list based on the value in the text input field. When the remove icon is clicked, the corresponding item is removed from the list.\n\nThe YAML file also includes properties and annotations to customize the appearance and behavior of the components. For example, the text input field is disabled and has a placeholder, the add button has an icon, and the remove icon displays a loading message while the item is being deleted.\n\nOverall, this YAML file provides a template for a list view with input fields, buttons, and dynamic item manipulation that can be customized and integrated into a Lowdefy application.","completion":"id: listagem1\ntype: Context\n\nstyle:\n  display: flex\n  justify-content: center\n\nlayout:\n  contentGutter: 16\n\n\nblocks:\n  - id: todo_input\n    type: TextInput\n    layout:\n      grow: 1\n    properties:\n      label:\n        disabled: true\n      placeholder: Digite um item\n  - id: add_item\n    type: Button\n    layout:\n      shrink: 1\n    properties:\n      title: Adicionar\n      icon: PlusOutlined\n    events:\n      onClick:\n        - id: add\n          type: SetState\n          params:\n            todos:\n              _array.concat:\n                - - _state: todo_input\n                - _state: todos\n            todo_input: null\n  - id: todos\n    type: List\n    layout:\n      contentGutter: 16\n    blocks:\n      - id: todos.$\n        type: TitleInput\n        layout:\n          grow: 1\n        properties:\n          level: 4\n      - id: remove_item\n        type: Icon\n        layout:\n          shrink: 1\n        properties:\n          name: MinusCircleOutlined\n          size: 18\n        events:\n          onClick:\n            - id: remove\n              type: CallMethod\n              messages:\n                loading: Carregando\n                success: Item deletado com sucesso\n              params:\n                blockId: todos\n                method: removeItem\n                args:\n                  - _index: 0"}

It also includes information about the required and optional properties for the connection, as well as examples of how to configure the connection with API keys, service accounts, and other settings.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/general.yaml.njk\n  vars:\n    pageId: GoogleSheet\n    pageTitle: Google Sheets\n    section: Connections\n    filePath: connections\/GoogleSheet.yaml\n    content:\n      - id: markdown\n        type: MarkdownWithCode\n        properties:\n          content: |\n            ## Connections\n\n            Connection types:\n              - GoogleSheet\n\n            ### GoogleSheet\n\n            The `GoogleSheet` connection can be used to connect to a Google using an API key or a service account. An API key can only be used for read-only access to public sheets, so most applications should use a service account. A guide to creating a service account can be found in the [tutorial](\/tutorial-requests).\n\n            This connection refers to the entire document as the `spreadsheet`, and the individual sheets in the document as `sheets`. The spreadsheet is identified by it's `spreadsheetId`, and sheets can either be identified by their `sheetId` or their `index` (position in the document starting from 0).\n\n            When a sheet is accessed in a browser the url either looks like:\n            `https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/{spreadsheetId}\/edit#gid={sheetId}`\n\n            The `GoogleSheet` connection works with sheets as a row based data store. Each row is a data record, and a header row needs to be present to define the column names. This header needs to be created in the Google Sheets web interface. Types can be specified for any of the columns in the sheet. If a type is not specified, the value will be read as a string. The `json` type will stringify a object as JSON before saving it, and parse it again when reading.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `apiKey: string`: API key for your google project.\n            - `client_email: string`: The email address of your service account.\n            - `private_key: string`: The private key for your service account.

One of `sheetId` or `sheetIndex` is required.\n            - `spreadsheetId: string`: __Required__ - The document ID from the URL of the spreadsheet.\n            - `columnTypes: object`: An object that defines the data types for each column. Each key should be the column name, and the value should be one of: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, or `json`.\n            - `read: boolean`: Default: `true` - Allow read operations like find on the sheet.\n            - `write: boolean`: Default: `false` - Allow write operations like update on the sheet.\n\n            #### Examples\n\n            ###### Read only access to first sheet in a public spreadsheet:\n            ```yaml\n            connections:\n              - id: public_sheet\n                type: GoogleSheet\n                properties:\n                  apiKey:\n                    _secret: GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY\n                  sheetIndex: 0\n                  spreadsheetId: ubQsWYNGRUq0gFB1sAp2r9oYE19lZ8yGA1T6y0yBoLPW\n            ```\n\n            ###### Access with a service account, with defined types:\n            ```yaml\n            connections:\n              - id: my_sheet\n                type: GoogleSheet\n                properties:\n                  client_email:\n                    _secret: GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL\n                  private_key:\n                    _base64.decode:\n                      _secret: GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY\n                  sheetId: '1199545345'\n                  spreadsheetId: ubQsWYNGRUq0gFB1sAp2r9oYE19lZ8yGA1T6y0yBoLPW\n                  columnTypes:\n                    name: string\n                    age: number\n                    birthday: date\n                    subscribed: boolean\n                    address: json\n            ```\n\n            ## Requests\n\n            Request types:\n              - GoogleSheetAppendMany\n              - GoogleSheetAppendOne\n              - GoogleSheetDeleteOne\n              - GoogleSheetGetMany\n              - GoogleSheetGetOne\n              - GoogleSheetUpdateMany\n              - GoogleSheetUpdateOne\n\n            ### GoogleSheetAppendMany\n\n            The `GoogleSheetAppendMany` request inserts an array of documents as rows in a Google Sheet.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `rows: object[]`: __Required__ - The rows to insert into the sheet.

{"prompt":"The Lowdefy YAML file name \"MongoDB.yaml\" suggests that it contains the configuration for connecting to a MongoDB database. The file provides information about the MongoDB database, collections, and the properties associated with them. It includes details on how to establish a connection to the MongoDB deployment, specify the database name, collection name, and set various options for read and write operations. The YAML file also includes examples of different MongoDB requests such as aggregation, find, insert, update, and delete operations, along with their respective properties and options.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/general.yaml.njk\n  vars:\n    pageId: MongoDB\n    pageTitle: MongoDB\n    section: Connections\n    filePath: connections\/MongoDB.yaml\n    content:\n      - id: markdown\n        type: MarkdownWithCode\n        properties:\n          content: |\n            MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores JSON-like documents. These documents are stored in collections, which are like database tables. The fields inside these document can differ from document to document, but generally they are all more or less the same. However documents with different schemas can be stored in the same collection.\n\n            ##### ObjectIds\n\n            MongoDB uses the _id field as the id for a document. This has to be unique for every document in the collection. If no _id is provided when the document is created, a MongoDB [ObjectId](https:\/\/docs.mongodb.com\/manual\/reference\/method\/ObjectId\/) is created for that document. This id includes a timestamp, a random element and an incrementing counter, to ensure it is unique even if multiple ids are created at the same time.\n\n            The _id is often represented as:\n\n            ```js\n            {\n              _id: ObjectId(\"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\")\n            }\n            ```\n\n            To be able to transmit these ids over JSON network connections, and to use them in Lowdefy apps, Lowdefy serializes these ids as (in YAML):\n            ```yaml\n            _id:\n              _oid: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\n            ```\n\n            Ids specified in this way will be treated as ObjectIds by MongoDB requests and mutations.\n\n\n            ## Connections\n\n            Connection types:\n              - MongoDBCollection\n\n            ### MongoDBCollection\n\n            The `MongoDBCollection` connection sets up a connection to a MongoDB deployment. A [connection URI](https:\/\/docs.mongodb.com\/manual\/reference\/connection-string\/index.html) with authentication credentials (username and password) is required. The URI can be in the standard or dns seedlist (srv) formats. Connections are defined on a collection level, since this allows for read\/write access control on a per collection level. Access control can also be managed using the roles in the database.\n\n            >Since the connection URI contains authentication secrets, it should be stored using the [`_secret`](operators\/secret.md) operator.\n\n            When using MongoDBUpdateOne and MongoDBDeleteOne requests, take note that the responses differ if the connection has a log collection.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `databaseUri: string`: __Required__ - Connection uri string for the MongoDb deployment.

It returns the array of documents returned by the aggregation. Aggregation pipelines are MongoDB's data processing and aggregation framework. They are based on a series of stages, each of which apply a transformation to the data passed through them, like sorting, grouping or calculating additional fields.\n\n            >Cursors are not supported.

{"prompt":"The name of the Lowdefy YAML file is \"Header.yaml\". Based on the README and the annotations in the YAML file, it appears to be a configuration file for a header component in a Lowdefy app. The header component is used to display various elements such as a search box, buttons, and links.\n\nThe YAML file includes the configuration for different blocks that make up the header component. It defines blocks such as a search box, buttons for \"Why Lowdefy,\" \"Getting Started,\" \"Join our Discord,\" and \"Star on Github.\" Each block has its own properties, layout, and events.\n\nThe search box block is a Box component that contains a DocSearch component. It allows users to search for documentation related to Lowdefy.\n\nThe \"Why Lowdefy\" button, \"Getting Started\" button, \"Join our Discord\" button, and \"Star on Github\" button are all Button components. Each button has its own properties, such as the title, type, size, and href (link).\n\nThe YAML file also includes visibility conditions for the buttons based on the screen size. For example, some buttons may not be visible on smaller screens.\n\nOverall, the YAML file serves as a configuration guide for creating a header component in a Lowdefy app, with various elements such as a search box and buttons.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n- id: search_box\n  type: Box\n  layout:\n    flex: 0 1 auto\n    align: middle\n  style:\n    marginRight: 8\n  blocks:\n    - id: docsearch\n      type: DocSearch\n      layout:\n        flex: 0 1 auto\n        align: middle\n      properties:\n        appId: TTP0C3FN0L\n        indexName: lowdefy\n        apiKey:\n          _build.env: DOCSEARCH_API_KEY\n- id: why_button\n  type: Button\n  visible:\n    _not:\n      _or:\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - md\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - sm\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - xs\n  layout:\n    flex: 1 0 auto\n  properties:\n    title: Why Lowdefy\n    type: text\n    size: large\n    href: https:\/\/lowdefy.com\n- id: tutorial_button\n  type: Button\n  visible:\n    _not:\n      _or:\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - md\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - sm\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - xs\n  layout:\n    flex: 1 0 auto\n  properties:\n    title: Getting Started\n    type: text\n    size: large\n  events:\n    onClick:\n      - id: tutorial_link\n        type: Link\n        params:\n          pageId: tutorial-start\n- id: community_button\n  type: Button\n  visible:\n    _not:\n      _or:\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - sm\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - xs\n  layout:\n    flex: 1 0 auto\n  properties:\n    title: Join our Discord\n    type: text\n    size: large\n    href: https:\/\/discord.gg\/WmcJgXt\n- id: github_button\n  type: Button\n  visible:\n    _not:\n      _or:\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - sm\n        - _eq:\n            - _media: size\n            - xs\n  layout:\n    flex: 1 0 auto\n  properties:\n    title: Star on Github\n    type: text\n    icon: AiFillGithub\n    size: large\n    href: https:\/\/github.com\/lowdefy\/lowdefy\n"}
{"prompt":"The name of the Lowdefy YAML file is \"_event.yaml\". This file contains the configuration for the \"_event\" operator in a Lowdefy app. The \"_event\" operator is used to retrieve values from the \"event\" object, which is a data object provided to an action by an event. This object is also available to requests or connections called by the Request action.\n\nThe YAML file includes the operator's ID, type, arguments, and examples. The operator can be called with different argument types:\n\n1. If called with a string argument, it returns the value of the specified key in the event object. If the value is not found, it returns null. Dot notation and block list indexes are supported.\n\n2. If called with a boolean argument set to true, it returns the entire event object.\n\n3. If called with an object argument, it provides more control:\n   - If the \"all\" property is set to true, it returns the entire event object.\n   - If the \"key\" property is provided, it returns the value of the specified key in the event object. If the value is not found, it returns null or the specified default value.\n   - The \"default\" property allows specifying a default value to return if the key is not found in the event object. By default, null is returned if the value is not found.\n\nThe examples provided demonstrate how to use the \"_event\" operator to retrieve values from the event object. It shows how to get the value of a specific key, retrieve the entire event object, use dot notation for nested keys, and handle default values. It also showcases the usage of block list indexes to access values in an array within the event object.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/operators.yaml.njk\n  transformer: templates\/operatorsMethodTransformer.js\n  vars:\n    pageId: _event\n    pageTitle: _event\n    filePath: operators\/_event.yaml\n    env: Client Only\n    types: |\n      ```\n      (key: string): any\n      (all: boolean): any\n      (arguments: {\n        all?: boolean,\n        key?: string,\n        default?: any\n      }): any\n      ```\n    description: |\n      The `_event` operator gets a value from the `event` object.

The Box component has a style property that sets the text alignment to right and a layout property that specifies a span of 8.\n\nWithin the Box component, there is an Html component with the ID \"connect\" that displays social media icons and links. The Html component uses HTML code to create anchor tags with links to different social platforms such as Twitter, GitHub Discussions, Discord, GitHub, and YouTube. Each anchor tag includes an image tag with the respective social media icon and sets the aria-label attribute for accessibility purposes.\n\nThe connect.yaml file is responsible for defining and configuring the section that allows users to connect with the software or application through various social platforms. It provides links to these platforms and displays their corresponding icons. This section enhances user engagement and facilitates communication and collaboration with the software's community.","completion":"id: connect_box\ntype: Box\nstyle:\n  textAlign: right\nlayout:\n  span: 8\nblocks:\n  - id: connect\n    type: Html\n    properties:\n      html: |\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lowdefy\"\n          aria-label=\"twitter\"\n          style=\"margin-left: 12px;\"\n        >\n          <img src='images\/social\/twitter.svg' alt=\"twitter\" width='28'\/>\n        <\/a>\n        <a\n          href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/lowdefy\/lowdefy\/discussions\"\n          aria-label=\"github discussions\"\n          style=\"margin-left: 12px;\"\n        >\n          <img src='images\/social\/discussions.svg' alt=\"discussions\" width='28' \/>\n        <\/a>\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/WmcJgXt\"\n          aria-label=\"discord\"\n          style=\"margin-left: 12px;\"\n        >\n          <img src='images\/social\/discord.svg' alt=\"discord\" width='28' \/>\n        <\/a>\n        <a\n          href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/lowdefy\/lowdefy\"\n          aria-label=\"github\"\n          style=\"margin-left: 12px;\"\n        >\n          <img src='images\/social\/github.svg' alt=\"github\" width='28' \/>\n        <\/a>\n        <a\n          href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCQLUr15MfP_9yGSO5dmf9wg\"\n          aria-label=\"youtube\"\n          style=\"margin-left: 12px;\"\n        >\n          <img src='images\/social\/youtube.svg' alt=\"youtube\" width='28' \/>\n        <\/a>\n"}
{"prompt":"The name of the Lowdefy YAML file is \"Elasticsearch.yaml\". Based on the README and the annotations in the YAML file, it appears to be a configuration file for an Elasticsearch connection in a Lowdefy app. Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine that centrally stores data for fast search, relevancy, and analytics.\n\nThe YAML file provides information about the connection type, properties, and examples of how to configure the Elasticsearch connection. It mentions that Lowdefy integrates with Elasticsearch using the official Node.js client from Elastic Co. It also provides details about the required and optional properties for the connection, such as the Elasticsearch nodes to connect to, default index, authentication, and timeouts.\n\nThe YAML file also includes information about the available request types for Elasticsearch, such as delete, index, search, and update. It provides properties and examples for each request type, including the query body, options, and examples of how to use them.\n\nOverall, the YAML file serves as a configuration guide for connecting to and interacting with Elasticsearch in a Lowdefy app.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/general.yaml.njk\n  vars:\n    pageId: Elasticsearch\n    pageTitle: Elasticsearch\n    section: Connections\n    filePath: connections\/Elasticsearch.yaml\n    content:\n      - id: markdown\n        type: MarkdownWithCode\n        properties:\n          content: |\n            ## Connections\n\n            Connection types:\n              - Elasticsearch\n\n            ### Elasticsearch\n\n            [`Elasticsearch`](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/elasticsearch\/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fine\u2011tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.\n\n            The Elasticsearch connection can be used to search for documents in your Elasticsearch cluster. Lowdefy integrates with Elasticsearch using the official [Node.js client from Elastic Co.](https:\/\/www.elastic.co\/guide\/en\/elasticsearch\/client\/javascript-api\/current\/introduction.html), and provides direct access to the full query DSL supported by Elasticsearch.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `node: string|string[]`: __Required__ - Elasticsearch node(s) to connect to.\n            - `index: string`: The default index to query. You can also provide a per-request index to override this setting.\n            - `auth: BasicAuth|CloudAuth`: The authentication data as an object, containing either basic auth credentials (as `username` and `password`), an API key (as `apiKey`), or Elastic Cloud credentials.\n            - `maxRetries: number`: Max number of retries for each request.\n            - `requestTimeout: number`: Max request timeout in milliseconds for each request.\n\n            The connection accepts many more advanced configuration options.

{"prompt":"The YAML file provided is a template for creating a connection configuration for the \"AxiosHttp\" connection in the Lowdefy framework. The template includes a description of the connection, stating that it is used to connect to APIs and web servers using HTTP or HTTPS, and it utilizes the [axios](https:\/\/github.com\/axios\/axios) library. \n\nThe template also provides a list of properties that can be set for the \"AxiosHttp\" connection, including the URL for the server, the request method, headers, parameters, data to be sent in the request body, authentication credentials, proxy settings, response type, timeout, and more. \n\nThe template includes examples of how to use the connection configuration, such as setting the baseURL and authorization in the connection and handling specific requests as separate entities. It also demonstrates how to set properties on only the connection or only the request, as well as using a generic connection for multiple requests.\n\nOverall, this YAML file serves as a template for configuring the \"AxiosHttp\" connection in Lowdefy, allowing users to connect to APIs and web servers and define various properties and settings for their requests.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/general.yaml.njk\n  vars:\n    pageId: AxiosHttp\n    pageTitle: AxiosHttp\n    section: Connections\n    filePath: connections\/AxiosHttp.yaml\n    content:\n      - id: markdown\n        type: MarkdownWithCode\n        properties:\n          content:\n            _nunjucks:\n              on:\n                version:\n                  _ref: version.yaml\n              template: |\n                The `AxiosHttp` connection is used to connect to APIs and web servers using HTTP or HTTPS.\n\n                It uses the [axios](https:\/\/github.com\/axios\/axios) library.\n\n                The same properties can be set on both connections and requests.

Can be an object, array or a string in the format `'Country=Brasil&City=Belo Horizonte'`.\n                - `auth: object`: Indicates that HTTP Basic authorization should be used, and supplies credentials. This will set an `Authorization` header, overwriting any existing `Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`. Only HTTP Basic auth is configurable through this parameter, for Bearer tokens and such, use `Authorization` custom headers instead. The `auth` object should have the following fields:\n                  - `username: string`\n                  - `password: string`\n                - `httpAgentOptions: object`: Options to pass to the Node.js [`http.Agent`](https:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/http.html#http_class_http_agent) class.\n                - `httpsAgentOptions: object`: Options to pass to the Node.js [`https.Agent`](https:\/\/nodejs.org\/api\/http.html#http_class_http_agent) class.\n                - `maxContentLength: number`: Defines the max size of the http response content allowed in bytes.\n                - `maxRedirects: number`: Defines the maximum number of redirects to follow. If set to 0, no redirects will be followed.\n                - `proxy: object`: Defines the hostname and port of the proxy server. The `proxy` object should have the following fields:\n                  - `host: string`: Host IP address (eg. `'127.0.0.1'`).\n                  - `port: number`: Port number.\n                  - `auth: object`: Object with username and password.\n                - `responseType: enum`: Default: `'json'` - The type of data that the server will respond with. Options are:\n                  - `'document'`\n                  - `'json'`\n                  - `'text'`\n                - `responseEncoding: string`: Default: `'utf8'` - Indicates encoding to use for decoding responses.\n                - `timeout: number`: Default: `0` (no timeout) - The number of milliseconds before the request times out. If the request takes longer than `timeout`, the request will be aborted. Set to `0` for no timeout.\n                - `transformRequest: function`: A function to transform the request data before it is sent. Receives `data` and `headers` as arguments and should return the data to be sent.\n                - `transformResponse: function`: A function to transform the received data.

This connection is configured to have a base URL of \"https:\/\/base.chibifire.com\/api\" and includes headers with an Authorization token.\n\nThe YAML file also includes a section for defining pages, where a page with an id of \"remixable-godot-engine-tools-non-copyleft\" is defined. This page uses a PageHeaderMenu type and includes a request with an id of \"get_rows\" that uses the AxiosHttp connection defined earlier. The request is configured to make a GET request to the \"\/database\/rows\/table\/889\/?user_field_names=true\" endpoint.\n\nAdditionally, the page includes an event that triggers on page enter, which includes a request with an id of \"fetch_get_posts\" that uses the previously defined \"get_rows\" request as a parameter.\n\nFinally, the page includes a block with an id of \"rest_data\" that uses the Markdown type and includes content in YAML format. The content includes a concatenation of strings that includes a code block with YAML syntax highlighting and a call to the \"_log\" function with the request \"get_rows\" as a parameter.","completion":"\nlowdefy: 3.23.3\nname: Lowdefy starter\n\nconnections:\n  - id: base_chibifire_com\n    type: AxiosHttp\n    properties:\n      baseURL:  https:\/\/base.chibifire.com\/api\n      headers:\n        Authorization: \"Token o6H9vk5WC9lL1IF2RQWFaKqVZj7LWxwg\"\npages:\n  - id: remixable-godot-engine-tools-non-copyleft\n    type: PageHeaderMenu\n    requests:\n      - id: get_rows\n        type: AxiosHttp\n        connectionId: base_chibifire_com\n        properties:\n          url: \/database\/rows\/table\/889\/?user_field_names=true\n    events:\n      onEnter:\n        - id: fetch_get_posts\n          type: Request\n          params: get_rows\n    blocks:\n      - id: rest_data\n        type: Markdown\n        properties:\n          content:\n            _string.concat:\n              - |\n                ```yaml\n              - _yaml.stringify:\n                  - _log:\n                      _request: get_rows\n              - |\n                ```\n\n"}
{"prompt":"The `analytics.yaml` file is a YAML configuration file for a page in the Lowdefy Blog web app example. This page is responsible for displaying analytics related to the blog posts. \n\nThe file starts with an `id` field set to \"analytics\", indicating that this YAML file represents the analytics page. The `type` field is set to \"PageHeaderMenu\", indicating that this page is a header menu page type.\n\nThe `properties` section defines the properties of the page header menu. The `title` property is set to \"Analytics\", which will be displayed as the title in the browser tab. The `layout` section specifies that the content of the page should be centered.\n\nThe `requests` section defines two requests that will be made to the MongoDB database to fetch the analytics data. The first request, with the `id` \"blog_posts_by_flair\", uses MongoDB aggregation to group the blog posts by flair and count the number of documents for each flair. The second request, with the `id` \"blog_posts_by_likes\", groups the blog posts by flair and sums up the likes for each flair.\n\nThe `events` section defines an `onEnter` event that triggers the fetching of the request data before the page renders. This ensures that the charts on the page are populated with the data.\n\nThe `areas` section defines the content and footer areas of the page. The `content` area contains blocks for displaying the title, a pie chart for blog post flair analytics, and another pie chart for blog post likes analytics.

It takes an object as an argument and returns the stringified JSON. It also supports an optional `options` object, which can include settings like `stable` (to ensure equal objects are stringified to the same string) and `space` (to insert whitespace for legibility).\n\nThe file includes examples of how to use the operator with different scenarios. It demonstrates parsing a JSON string and stringifying an object as JSON. The examples show the expected return values for different scenarios.\n\nThe file also includes license information and a reference to a template file and a transformer file.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/operators.yaml.njk\n  transformer: templates\/operatorsMethodTransformer.js\n  vars:\n    pageId: _json\n    pageTitle: _json\n    filePath: operators\/_json.yaml\n    build: true\n    description: |\n      The `_json` parses and writes JSON strings.\n    methods:\n      - name: parse\n        types: |\n          ```\n          (value: string): any\n          ```\n        description: |\n          The `_json.parse` method parses a JSON string into an object.\n        arguments: |\n          ###### string\n          The string to parse.\n        examples: |\n          ###### Parse a JSON string:\n          ```yaml\n          _json.parse: '{\"key\": \"Value\", \"boolean\": true, \"array\": [1, 2]}'\n          ```\n          Returns:\n          ```\n          key: Value\n          boolean: true\n          array:\n            - 1\n            - 2\n          ```\n      - name: stringify\n        types: |\n          ```\n          ({on: any, options?: object}): string\n          ([on: any, options?: object]): string\n          ```\n        description: |\n          The `_json.stringify` method creates a JSON string from an object.\n        arguments: |\n          ###### object\n            - `on: any`: The object to stringify.\n            - `options: object`: Optional settings.\n              - `stable: boolean`: If set to true, equal objects will be stringified to the same string.

{"prompt":"The name of the YAML file is \"report.yaml\". It is used to define the structure and properties of a Lowdefy page called \"Report\". The page consists of a PageHeaderMenu component, which includes a title and a menu for navigation. The content of the page is divided into different areas, such as \"content\" and \"header\", each containing blocks of components.\n\nThe \"content\" area includes blocks for displaying charts and a table. The charts are created using the EChart component and are populated with data fetched from a MongoDB database using the MongoDBAggregation request type. The first chart is a bar chart that compares critic and viewer ratings by genre. The second chart is a pie chart that shows the counts of each genre. The table displays the top 100 movies with the largest difference between critic and viewer ratings, with columns for title, year, difference, viewer rating, critic rating, viewer reviews, and critic reviews.\n\nThe \"header\" area includes a block for an Affix component, which contains a Button component. Clicking on the button opens a new tab with the source code of the application on GitHub.\n\nOverall, the \"report.yaml\" file defines the layout and functionality of a BI report\/dashboard page in Lowdefy, connecting to a MongoDB database and displaying charts and a table based on the data.","completion":"id: report\ntype: PageHeaderMenu\nproperties:\n  title: Report\nlayout:\n  contentGutter: 16 # Set a gutter of 16px between all the cards on the page\nrequests:\n  # Request for the bar and pie charts\n  -

{"prompt":"The name of the Lowdefy YAML file is `_if_none.yaml`. It is a function-based operator that replaces the input value with an alternative if the value is of a \"none-type\" like `null` or `undefined`.\n\nThe YAML file includes a description of the operator, stating its purpose and functionality. It explains that the `_if_none` operator takes an array of two values: the first value is the value to test, and the second value is the replacement. If the first value is `null` or `undefined`, it is replaced with the second value.\n\nThe file includes examples of how to use the operator. It demonstrates scenarios where the value is and is not replaced based on its \"none-type\" status. The examples show the expected return values for different scenarios.\n\nThe file also includes license information and a reference to a template file and a transformer file.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/operators.yaml.njk\n  transformer: templates\/operatorsMethodTransformer.js\n  vars:\n    pageId: _if_none\n    pageTitle: _if_none\n    filePath: operators\/_if_none.yaml\n    build: true\n    types: |\n      ```\n      ([value: any, replacement: any]): any\n      ```\n    description: |\n      The `_if_none` operator replaces the input value with an alternative if the value is of a \"none-type\" like `null` or `undefined`.\n    arguments: |\n      ###### array\n      - First value: The value to test.\n      - Second value: The replacement.\n    examples: |\n      ###### The value is not replaced if it is not of a none-type:\n      ```yaml\n      _if_none:\n        - Value\n        - Replacement\n      ```\n      Returns: `Value`\n\n      ###### The value is replaced if it is of a none-type:\n      ```yaml\n      _if_none:\n        - null\n        - \"Replacement\"\n      ```\n      Returns: `\"Replacement\"`\n\n      ```yaml\n      _if_none:\n        - _state: does_not_exist # Value in state that does not exist\n        - \"Replacement\"\n      ```\n      Returns: `\"Replacement\"`\n\n       ```yaml\n      _if_none:\n        - _request: still_loading # _request returns null if the request is loading\n        - []\n      ```\n      Returns: `[]`\n"}
{"prompt":"The name of the Lowdefy YAML file is \"new-ticket.yaml\".\n\nBased on the README and the annotations in the YAML file, it appears that this YAML file defines a function for creating a new ticket in the case management app. The function is responsible for displaying a page header menu with the title \"New Ticket\" and a content area where users can input information for the new ticket.\n\nThe YAML file includes the following components:\n- id: This is the ID of the new ticket page header menu, which is \"new-ticket\".\n- type: This specifies the type of component, which is \"PageHeaderMenu\". This indicates that the new ticket component is a page header menu.\n- properties: This section defines the properties of the new ticket component, such as the title and content style.\n- requests: This section specifies the requests to be made when certain events occur. In this case, it references a YAML file that defines the request for inserting a new ticket.\n- areas: This section defines the different areas of the page header menu, such as the header and content areas.\n- blocks: This section contains the blocks that are contained within the content area of the page header menu.\n\nEach block represents a specific component within the content area, such as the ticket title, name input, company autocomplete, phone input, ticket type selector, ticket description textarea, and submit button. Each component has its own properties, layout, and events defined.\n\nThe properties for each component include details such as the title, size, required status, and options for selectors and autocompletes.\n\nThe events for the submit button component define the actions to be performed when the button is clicked.

An API key can only be used for read-only access to public sheets, so most applications should use a service account. A guide to creating a service account can be found in the [tutorial](\/tutorial-requests).\n\n            This connection refers to the entire document as the `spreadsheet`, and the individual sheets in the document as `sheets`. The spreadsheet is identified by it's `spreadsheetId`, and sheets can either be identified by their `sheetId` or their `index` (position in the document starting from 0).\n\n            When a sheet is accessed in a browser the url either looks like:\n            `https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/{spreadsheetId}\/edit#gid={sheetId}`\n\n            The `GoogleSheet` connection works with sheets as a row based data store. Each row is a data record, and a header row needs to be present to define the column names. This header needs to be created in the Google Sheets web interface. Types can be specified for any of the columns in the sheet. If a type is not specified, the value will be read as a string. The `json` type will stringify a object as JSON before saving it, and parse it again when reading.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `apiKey: string`: API key for your google project.\n            - `client_email: string`: The email address of your service account.\n            - `private_key: string`: The private key for your service account. Base64 encode the string if you have issues with the newline characters in the string.\n            - `sheetId: string`: The ID of the worksheet. Can be found in the URL as the \"gid\" parameter. One of `sheetId` or `sheetIndex` is required.\n            - `sheetIndex: number`: The position of the worksheet as they appear in the Google sheets UI. Starts from 0. One of `sheetId` or `sheetIndex` is required.\n            - `spreadsheetId: string`: __Required__ - The document ID from the URL of the spreadsheet.\n            - `columnTypes: object`: An object that defines the data types for each column. Each key should be the column name, and the value should be one of: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, or `json`.\n            - `read: boolean`: Default: `true` - Allow read operations like find on the sheet.\n            - `write: boolean`: Default: `false` - Allow write operations like update on the sheet.\n\n            #### Examples\n\n            ###### Read only access to first sheet in a public spreadsheet:\n            ```yaml\n            connections:\n              - id: public_sheet\n                type: GoogleSheet\n                properties:\n                  apiKey:\n                    _secret: GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY\n                  sheetIndex: 0\n                  spreadsheetId: ubQsWYNGRUq0gFB1sAp2r9oYE19lZ8yGA1T6y0yBoLPW\n            ```\n\n            ###### Access with a service account, with defined types:\n            ```yaml\n            connections:\n              - id: my_sheet\n                type: GoogleSheet\n                properties:\n                  client_email:\n                    _secret: GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL\n                  private_key:\n                    _base64.decode:\n                      _secret: GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY\n                  sheetId: '1199545345'\n                  spreadsheetId: ubQsWYNGRUq0gFB1sAp2r9oYE19lZ8yGA1T6y0yBoLPW\n                  columnTypes:\n                    name: string\n                    age: number\n                    birthday: date\n                    subscribed: boolean\n                    address: json\n            ```\n\n            ## Requests\n\n            Request types:\n              - GoogleSheetAppendMany\n              - GoogleSheetAppendOne\n              - GoogleSheetDeleteOne\n              - GoogleSheetGetMany\n              - GoogleSheetGetOne\n              - GoogleSheetUpdateMany\n              - GoogleSheetUpdateOne\n\n            ### GoogleSheetAppendMany\n\n            The `GoogleSheetAppendMany` request inserts an array of documents as rows in a Google Sheet.\n\n            #### Properties\n            - `rows: object[]`: __Required__ - The rows to insert into the sheet.

It provides methods for encoding and decoding URIs, which involves converting special characters and non-ASCII characters into a format that is valid within a URI.\n\nThe `_uri` operator has the following methods:\n\n- `decode`: The `_uri.decode` method decodes a string that has been URI-encoded. It uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to perform the decoding. The method takes a string argument and returns the decoded string.\n- `encode`: The `_uri.encode` method URI-encodes a string. It uses the `encodeURIComponent` function to perform the encoding. The method takes a string argument and returns the encoded string.\n\nThe YAML file provides examples of how to use the `_uri` operator. It demonstrates decoding a URI-encoded string using the `decode` method and encoding a string using the `encode` method. Each example shows the input string and the resulting decoded or encoded string.\n\nOverall, the `_uri.yaml` file defines the behavior and usage of the `_uri` operator in Lowdefy, allowing users to encode and decode URIs using the provided methods.","completion":"# Copyright 2020-2023 Lowdefy, Inc\n\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n#     http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\n_ref:\n  path: templates\/operators.yaml.njk\n  transformer: templates\/operatorsMethodTransformer.js\n  vars:\n    pageId: _uri\n    pageTitle: _uri\n    filePath: operators\/_uri.yaml\n    build: true\n    description: |\n      The `_uri` operator [encodes and decodes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Percent-encoding) Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI).

If the referenced file has a `.yaml` or `.json` extension, the contents of the file will be parsed, else the file content is included as a string (this is useful for `.md` or `.html` files). As an example of splitting an app into logically distinct files, references can be used to write each page as a separate file:\n\n            ###### lowdefy.yaml\n            ```yaml\n            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION\n\n            pages:\n              _ref: pages\/page1.yaml # Path to the referenced file. Always from the root of the project.\n              _ref: pages\/page1.yaml\n            ```\n\n            ## Using References as Templates for Improved Reusability\n\n            The `_ref` operator can take an argument called `vars`. This can be any data, and is passed down to later be accessed with the [`_var`](\/_var) operator. By using vars, the referenced file can become a template, using the given variables. For example, a standard page template might be used for multiple pages in an app:\n\n            ###### pages\/page1.yaml\n            ```yaml\n            _ref:\n              path: templates\/text_page.yaml\n              vars:\n                id: page1\n                title: Page 1\n                content:\n                  _ref: markdowns\/content.md\n            ```\n\n            ###### markdowns\/content.md\n            ```yaml\n            Page content text.\n            ```\n\n            ###### templates\/text_page.yaml\n            ```yaml\n            id:\n              _var: id\n            type: PageHeaderMenu\n            properties:\n              title:\n                _var: title\n            blocks:\n              - id: content_card\n                type: Card\n                blocks:\n                  - id: title\n                    type: Title\n                    properties:\n                      content:\n                        _var: title\n                  - id: content\n                    type: Markdown\n                    properties:\n                      content:\n                        _var: content\n            ```\n\n            ## Nunjucks Templating\n\n            Templating can be taken further by referencing [Nunjucks](https:\/\/mozilla.github.io\/nunjucks\/) template files. If a file ends with the `.njk` file extension, the file will first be hydrated as a Nunjucks template, using the `vars` as template variables. If the file ends with `.yaml.njk` or `.json.njk`, the output of the template will then be parsed. Nunjucks templates are useful since the template file does not need to be valid yaml before it is hydrated, and features like for-loops and if-statements can be used.\n\n            Templating is used extensively to create the Lowdefy docs (these docs are a Lowdefy app). You can look at how they are used [here](https:\/\/github.com\/lowdefy\/lowdefy\/tree\/main\/packages\/docs).\n\n            We can modify the example above to make use of nunjucks templating to allow us to add subsections to our page. This can be done as follows:\n\n            ###### pages\/page1.yaml\n            ```yaml\n            _ref:\n              path: templates\/text_page.yaml.njk\n              vars:\n                id: page1\n                title: Page 1\n                content:\n                  _ref: markdowns\/content.md\n                subsections:\n                  - id: subsection1\n                    title: Subsection 1\n                    content: |\n                      Subsection 1 content text.\n                  - id: subsection2\n                    title: Subsection 2\n                    content: |\n                      Subsection 2 content text.\n            ```\n\n            ###### markdowns\/content.md\n            ```yaml\n            Page content text.\n            ```\n\n            ###### templates\/text_page.yaml.njk\n            ```yaml\n            id:\n              _var: id\n            type: PageHeaderMenu\n            properties:\n              title:\n                _var: title\n            blocks:\n              - id: content_card\n                type: Card\n                blocks:\n                  - id: title\n                    type: Title\n                    properties:\n                      content:\n                        _var: title\n                  - id: content\n                    type: Markdown\n                    properties:\n                      content:\n                        _var: content\n                  {% if subsections %}\n                  {% for subsection in subsections %}\n                  - id: {{ subsection.id }}_title\n                    type: Title\n                    properties:\n                      content: {{ subsection.title }}\n                  - id: {{ subsection.id }}_content\n                    type: Markdown\n                    properties:\n                      content: {{ subsection.content }}\n                  {% endfor %}\n                  {% endif %}\n            ```\n\n            ## Custom JavaScript Functions\n\n            TODO: Test common js vs es module exports\n\n            The `_ref` operator can also be extended with custom JavaScript functions. A `resolver` function can be specified, which can overwrite the default way configuration files are read from the filesystem. A `transformer` function can be used to transform the value returned by the `_ref` operator.\n\n            ### Resolver\n\n            This resolver function will first look for the configuration file in the current working directory, but if the file is not found it will be read from an adjacent \"shared\" directory. This pattern can be used to build apps that mostly use a shared configuration, with a few components that are customised per app.\n\n            ###### resolvers\/useLocalOrSharedConfig.js\n            ```js\n            const fs = require('fs');\n            const path = require('path');\n            const { promisify } = require('util');\n\n            const readFilePromise = promisify(fs.readFile);\n\n            async function useLocalOrSharedConfig(refPath, vars, context) {\n              let fileContent\n              try {\n                fileContent =  await readFilePromise(path.resolve(refPath), 'utf8');\n                return fileContent;\n              } catch (error) {\n                if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {\n                  fileContent = readFilePromise(path.resolve('..\/shared', refPath), 'utf8');\n                  return fileContent;\n                }\n                throw error;\n              }\n\n\n            }\n\n            module.exports = useLocalOrSharedConfig;\n            ```\n\n            ###### lowdefy.yaml\n            ```yaml\n            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION\n\n            cli:\n              refResolver: resolvers\/useLocalOrSharedConfig.js\n\n            pages:\n              - _ref: pages\/local-page.yaml\n              - _ref: pages\/shared-page.yaml\n            ```\n\n            ### Transformer\n\n            This transformer adds a standard footer to each page:\n\n            ###### transformers\/addFooter.js\n            ```js\n            function addFooter(page, vars) {\n              const footer = {\n                \/\/ ...\n              };\n              page.areas.footer = footer;\n              return page;\n            }\n            module.exports = addFooter;\n            ```\n\n            ###### lowdefy.yaml\n            ```yaml\n            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION\n\n            pages:\n              - _ref:\n                  path: pages\/page1.yaml\n                  transformer: transformers\/addFooter.js\n            ```\n      - _ref:\n          path: templates\/navigation_buttons.yaml\n          vars:\n            previous_page_title: Page and App State\n            previous_page_id: page-and-app-state\n            next_page_title: Menus\n            next_page_id: menus\n"}

{"prompt":"The name of the YAML file, \"Selector.yaml,\" suggests that it defines a block type called \"Selector.\" This block is likely used to create a drop-down selector that allows users to select a single value from a set of options. The YAML file includes various properties and configurations for this block, such as the value type, category, schema, and file path.
