# Frontend Dev Design Document

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the frontend design and development plan for the AI Says application. The frontend development team will be responsible for creating a user-friendly and responsive interface that allows Chinese retail investors to access the AI-powered chatbot, analyze stock data, and receive personalized recommendations and alerts. The design principles of user experience, user interface, design considerations, performance, security, testing, and rollout strategy will be followed throughout the development process.

## User Experience (UX)
### Responsiveness
The frontend application will be designed to be mobile-responsive, ensuring that users can access and use the AI Says chatbot on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

### Navigation
The navigation menu will be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to navigate between different pages and access different features of the application. The menu will be located in the header section of the application and will be consistent across all pages.

### Feedback
The application will provide feedback to users after key interactions, such as submitting a form or receiving a recommendation. This feedback can be in the form of success messages, error messages, or visual indicators to indicate the progress of a task.

### Loading Time
Efforts will be made to optimize the loading time of the application, ensuring that it loads quickly and provides a seamless user experience. Techniques such as lazy loading and caching will be implemented to improve performance.

### Accessibility

#### Call to Action Buttons
- Styled buttons will be used for key actions, such as submitting a form or accessing a specific feature.
- The buttons will be visually appealing and easily distinguishable from other elements on the page.

## Design Considerations
### Consistency
The frontend application will follow a uniform design language, ensuring that the design elements, colors, and typography are consistent across all pages. This will create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.

### Modularity
Efforts will be made to create reusable components, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability of the application. Components will be designed to be modular and independent, making it easier to add or modify functionality in the future.

### Interactivity
Subtle animations and transitions will be incorporated into the user interface to enhance the interactivity and engagement of the application. These animations will be used sparingly and purposefully to avoid overwhelming the user.

## Performance
### Optimize Images
All images used in the frontend application will be compressed and sized appropriately to minimize the loading time of the application. Efforts will be made to strike a balance between image quality and performance.

### Lazy Loading
Assets, such as images and scripts, will be loaded on demand to improve the initial loading time of the application. This technique will ensure that only the necessary assets are loaded when needed, reducing the overall load time.

### Caching
Frequently accessed data and assets will be cached to improve the performance of the application. This will reduce the need for repeated requests to the server and improve the responsiveness of the application.

## Security
### Input Validation
User inputs, such as form submissions, will be validated on the frontend to ensure that they meet the required format and prevent any potential security vulnerabilities. Input validation will be implemented using appropriate techniques and libraries.

### Data Transmission
Secure data transmission methods, such as HTTPS, will be used to protect user data during transmission. This will ensure that sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal details, are encrypted and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.

### Cookies and Local Storage
Any data stored in cookies or local storage will be encrypted or kept to a minimum to minimize the risk of data breaches. Efforts will be made to follow best practices for data storage and security.

## Testing
### Cross-Browser Testing
The frontend application will be tested on different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, to ensure uniformity and compatibility across all major browsers. Any browser-specific issues will be identified and addressed during the testing phase.

### Mobile Testing
The application will be tested on different mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, to ensure that it is responsive and functions correctly on various screen sizes. Any layout or functionality issues specific to mobile devices will be identified and fixed.

### User Testing
Real users will be involved in the testing process to gather feedback and identify any usability issues or areas of improvement. User feedback will be collected through surveys, interviews, or usability testing sessions. This feedback will be used to make iterative improvements to the frontend application.

## Rollout Strategy
### Beta Testing
A limited audience release will be conducted to gather feedback and identify any issues or bugs before the official release. The beta testing phase will involve a selected group of users who will have access to the application and provide feedback on its functionality, usability, and performance.

### Versioning
A versioning system will be implemented to easily roll back to stable versions in case any issues or bugs are identified after the official release. This will ensure that the application remains stable and reliable for users.

### Feedback Loop
A system will be put in place to collect and address user feedback after the official release. This feedback loop will allow for continuous improvement of the frontend application based on user needs and preferences. User feedback will be collected through various channels, such as email, support tickets, or a dedicated feedback form on the website.
