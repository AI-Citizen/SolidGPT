To structure a product brainstorming meeting for an AI product that can host Discord servers, auto-reply to members, and join discussions, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the problem: Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve with the AI product. In this case, the problem could be improving the efficiency and engagement of Discord server management.

2. Invite a diverse group: Include team members from different departments such as AI specialists, software engineers, UX/UI designers, and customer support representatives. This diversity will bring different perspectives and expertise to the brainstorming session.

3. Give people time to prepare: Prior to the meeting, share relevant background information and any available research or data on Discord server management. This will allow participants to familiarize themselves with the topic and generate ideas beforehand.

4. Create a supportive environment: Encourage open and inclusive communication where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. Emphasize that the focus is on generating ideas, not evaluating them during the brainstorming session.

5. Set a time limit: Allocate a specific time frame for the brainstorming session to keep it focused and prevent it from dragging on. For example, you could set a limit of 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the group.

6. Articulate the problem clearly: Remind the participants of the defined problem statement. This will help keep the discussion on track and ensure that the ideas generated are relevant to the specific problem of hosting Discord servers, auto-replying to members, and joining discussions.

7. Provide needed context: Share any relevant information, such as the current state of Discord server management, challenges faced by users, and potential opportunities for improvement. This will help participants understand the context and generate more targeted ideas.

8. Introduce visuals: Use visuals such as mockups or wireframes to stimulate creativity and provide a visual reference for the ideas being discussed. Visualizing the product concept can help participants generate more concrete ideas.

9. Aim for quantity: Encourage participants to generate a large number of ideas, even if some may seem far-fetched or unconventional. Quantity can lead to quality, as unexpected ideas may spark innovative solutions.

10. Be curious and ask questions: Promote curiosity and encourage participants to ask questions that challenge assumptions and explore new possibilities. This can lead to deeper insights and more innovative ideas.

11. Defer idea evaluation: During the brainstorming session, focus on idea generation rather than evaluating or critiquing ideas. This will create a more relaxed environment that encourages creativity and avoids stifling the flow of ideas.

12. Document everything: Assign a designated note-taker or use a virtual collaboration tool to capture all the ideas discussed during the meeting. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for future reference and evaluation.

13. Evaluate ideas against strategy: After the brainstorming session, gather the generated ideas and evaluate them against the product strategy and objectives. Identify the most promising ideas that align with the problem statement and have the potential to deliver value to users.

14. Follow up with attendees: Share the outcomes of the brainstorming session with all participants and express appreciation for their contributions. Encourage further collaboration and refinement of the selected ideas.

By following these steps, you can structure a product brainstorming meeting that encourages creativity, inclusivity, and generates innovative ideas for an AI product to host Discord servers, auto-reply to members, and join discussions.
