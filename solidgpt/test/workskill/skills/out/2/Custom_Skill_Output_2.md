To structure a product brainstorming meeting for developing an AI product for hosting Discord servers, auto-replying to members, and joining discussions, consider the following steps:

1. Define the Problem: Clearly articulate the problem you are trying to solve with the AI product. For example, the problem could be enhancing the user experience and engagement in Discord servers by automating certain tasks.

2. Invite a Diverse Group: Include cross-functional team members with knowledge and expertise in AI, chatbots, user experience, and Discord. This can ensure a variety of perspectives and ideas during the brainstorming session.

3. Provide Context and Materials: Share relevant materials such as product positioning, personas, and research about Discord server management and user behavior. This will help participants understand the background and context of the problem.

4. Set the Objective: Clearly state the objective of the brainstorming session, such as generating ideas for AI features that can enhance the hosting, auto-reply, and discussion joining functionalities in Discord servers.

5. Prepare Prompts: Create open-ended questions or prompts in advance to stimulate ideation. Examples could be, "What AI features can automate moderation tasks in Discord servers?" or "How can the AI product facilitate seamless participation and engagement in discussions?"

6. Create a Supportive Environment: Foster a non-judgmental and creative atmosphere where participants feel comfortable sharing their ideas. Encourage open discussion and remind the team that the focus should be on the ideas rather than the individuals suggesting them.

7. Aim for Quantity: Encourage participants to generate as many ideas as possible. Emphasize the importance of quantity over quality at this stage to allow for a wide range of possibilities.

8. Be Curious and Ask Questions: Encourage participants to ask questions and be curious about the problem and potential solutions. This can help uncover new insights and possibilities.

9. Defer Idea Evaluation: Avoid critiquing or evaluating ideas during the brainstorming session. The goal is to generate a large pool of ideas without prematurely dismissing any concepts.

10. Document Everything: Assign a note-taker or use collaborative software to record all the ideas proposed during the brainstorming session. Ensure that everyone can visually see the ideas to spark further discussion and build upon them.

11. Evaluate Ideas Against Strategy: After the brainstorming session, select a few promising ideas that align with the product strategy and objectives. Evaluate these ideas further to determine their feasibility and potential impact.

12. Follow-up: Schedule follow-up meetings or discussions to explore the selected ideas in more depth. This can include refining the ideas, conducting feasibility assessments, and developing prototypes or proof-of-concepts.

By following these suggested steps, you can structure a productive product brainstorming meeting for developing an AI product to host Discord servers, auto-reply to members, and join discussions.
