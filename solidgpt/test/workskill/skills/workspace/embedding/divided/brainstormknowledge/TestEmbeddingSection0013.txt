The “What If?” TechniqueWith this brainstorming technique, you’ll ask your team to respond to “what if?” scenarios related to the problem you’re trying to solve。 You can either come up with a list of questions in advance or ask your team to brainstorm both questions and answers。 Here are some “what if?” questions to get you started:What if this problem came up one hundred years in the past? (Or, alternatively, one hundred years in the future?) How would you solve it?What if you had only five minutes to solve this problem? What would you do?What if Google had this problem? (Or McDonald’s? Or BMW?) How would they solve it?What if a group of 10-year-olds had to solve this problem? How do you think they’d approach it?You can also adapt this technique by using other types of questions, including those specific to your industry or even the resources you have on hand
