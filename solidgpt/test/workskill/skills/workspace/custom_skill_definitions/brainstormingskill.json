Attendees feel satisfied after contributing their creative input and the product development team has a long list of ideas to investigate further. So how do you structure the meeting to be most effective? The exact parameters of your product brainstorming meeting will depend on a variety of factors — from the scope of the problem you are hoping to solve to the maturity of your product. However, there are a few consistent factors of which to be aware when organizing your product brainstorm meeting.\nSources\nYou want to invite the right people. Product brainstorming meetings can include internal or external sources. Examples of internal sources could be cross-functional teammates from departments such as engineering, marketing, sales, and support. These folks typically have different backgrounds, knowledge of your product, and level of exposure to customers. A diverse mix of internal sources can result in a high-yield brainstorm. Examples of external sources could be current customers, partners, or a focus group of people who represent users of your product. With external sources, you always want to consider how familiar the attendees might be with your market and offering — additional context may be required depending on who you choose to include.\nPoll the participants of an empathy session for additional insights.\n\nForum\nYou are likely familiar with the cliche image of a conference room with sticky notes plastered all over a white board. Although synonymous with brainstorming, this style of in-person meeting is not the only way — or the best way — to structure your meeting. In addition to limiting the number of people who will be able to join your meeting, this old-fashioned approach puts undue pressure on the product manager to record everything that is said. This is why many product teams choose purpose-built software that offers virtual and asynchronous options for idea management.\nSize\nTraditional brainstorm sessions capped group members at six to 12 people. Any more and you may miss out on quieter voices and lose track of the group. Any less and you may miss out on the potential for “piggybacking.”\nPreparation\nProduct managers are responsible for setting the context and agenda for the brainstorm. As part of meeting preparation, product managers gather related materials, articulate the objective of the session, and formulate prompts to keep the conversation going.\nThe objective should be simple to understand and can be a touchstone for reorienting the conversation if people get sidetracked. Examples of objectives for product ideation include:\nCome up with a better onboarding flow for customers\nImprove the mobile app experience\nRelated materials should be kept to a minimum, but available for the group’s reference as needed. The materials should be relevant to your sources (internal vs. external). Examples of materials for product ideation include:\nProduct positioning\nPersonas\nResearch or statistics\nMockups or wireframes\nDocumenting prompts in advance can be beneficial to spur ideation. Product managers can create open-ended questions ahead of time. Some software products designed for product development include interactive options such as polls. Examples of prompts for product ideation include:\nIf we had infinite resources, what would you suggest?\nHow do people solve this problem now?\nWhat would happen if we did not solve this problem?\nRelated guides:\nCustomer research templates\nProduct positioning templates\nSWOT analysis templates\nWhat are some best practices for product ideation?\nBrainstorming is a creative process. You do not want to create too many rules or stifle the group’s imagination. But there are a few best practices for product ideation that any team can benefit from — no matter what type of product you are building.\nKeep these tips top of mind when getting ready to brainstorm product ideas:\nReference product strategy\nInvite a diverse group\nGive people time to prepare\nCreate a supportive environment\nSet a time limit\nArticulate the problem clearly\nProvide needed context\nIntroduce visuals\nAim for quantity\nBe curious\nAsk questions\nDefer idea evaluation\nAvoid crosstalk\nDocument everything\nEvaluate ideas against strategy\nFollow up with attendees\n",
