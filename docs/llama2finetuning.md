# LLama2 Fine-Tuning for Lowdefy YAML Files (Test Version)

This code utilizes the LLama2 model to fine-tune Lowdefy YAML files, enabling the generation of bug-free Lowdefy files using a large language model. Follow the steps below to understand and use the provided code for fine-tuning and generating Lowdefy YAML files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. An environment with the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Overview

The provided code comprises several components to fine-tune the LLama2 model and generate Lowdefy YAML files:

1. `train.py`: Fine-tunes the LLama2 model using the specified training and validation datasets. Run the script using the command:

```sh
python train.py
```

2. `llamamanager.py`: Manages the LLama2 model, including loading the model, generating YAML files, and saving model parameters.

3. `dataloader.py`: Loads and preprocesses the training and validation datasets.

4. `llama2modelsetting.py`: Defines the LLama2 model settings, including model type and configuration.

5. `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage Example

1. Prepare your training and validation datasets in JSONL format, containing prompts and expected completions for fine-tuning.

2. Run the `train.py` script to fine-tune the LLama2 model with your datasets and specified settings. The fine-tuned model parameters will be saved.

3. Modify the `prompt` variable in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section of the script to define the prompt for generating a Lowdefy YAML file.

4. Optionally, specify the path to a template YAML file using the `user_template_path` variable.

5. The script will generate a Lowdefy YAML file based on the provided prompt and template (if specified).

## Notes

- Obtain permissions for using the LLama2 model from the official LLama2 site: [LLama2 Official Site](https://ai.meta.com/llama/).

- Make sure to provide paths to your training and validation datasets in the `LLamaModel` class.

- Fine-tuning may take some time depending on your dataset size and settings.

- Please follow ethical considerations and usage guidelines for fine-tuning and deploying large language models.

- Refer to the official LLama2 documentation and resources for further information and support.
