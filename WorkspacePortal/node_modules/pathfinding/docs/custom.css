/*This is a hack to prevent mkdocs from creating useless subheadings in table of
contents.
E.g. If there is a page called introduction.md and it contains the following:

# Introduction
Blah Blah Blah

Then mkdocs created a table of contents like this:

Introduction
    Introduction
	
This hack hides the second level heading
